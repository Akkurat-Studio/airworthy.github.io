                            <h4>Jan 2016</h4></div>
                        <p>Airworthy, LLC was a company that aimed to help pilots and aircraft navigate the copious
                            regulations to stay airworthy (“current” being the term used by pilots). Through the use of
                            mobile and web, we made it trivial (virtually automatic) to record flight time. We stored
                            logs in the cloud, and use the data to proactively inform pilots of their airworthy status.
                            Aircraft logs would come later.</p>

                        <p>As of Dec 2015, Airworthy, LLC has been closed. It’s a sad story, but not with out a silver
                            lining. I personally learned a lot from this adventure and I’d like to share my lessons
                            learned. But first, a brief timeline of events.</p>

                        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                        <h4>1. The CEO is the source of passion and drive.</h4>

                        <p>To explain, I have to give you some of my background. Airworthy was the third company I
                            started. The first was <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light, Inc.</a> and at the time I
                            was still an major owner and chairman of the board. My
                            duties at 8th Light consumed roughly 1 day a week. The second was <a
                                    href="http://cleancoders.com">Clean Coders, LLC</a>, and although I had recently
                            found a CEO (Tadd Linderman) to take over for me, I was working on a video series (Java Case
                            Study) with my father, Uncle Bob. This consumed roughly another day of my week.</p>

                        <p>When Justin, Nick and I were all in the office coding hard on Airworthy, it was not uncommon
                            for me to excuse myself to go work on for one of these other companies. I didn’t realize it
                            at the time, but this was hurtful to Nick, Justin, and the company at large. In the end,
                            Nick, and particularly Justin, told me that when they saw me leave, the felt that my passion
                            was not in Airworthy; that my other business were more important to me. Over time, their
                            passion and hard work tapered.</p>

                        <p>As the founder and CEO, you must be a well of passion. Your team will come to you to feed
                            from your passion. The more you put into the company, the more your team will put in.</p>
                        <h4>2. MVP; Don’t loose sight of it.</h4>

                        <p>In the beginning, Nick and I were building the basics of a pilot log book. This felt like the
                            natural place to start. Of course there were other digital log books out there, but ours was
                            going to be better. We had plans for grand features, but a we wanted to get a bare-bones
                            product (an MVP, or "Minimum Viable Product") done first.</p>

                        <p>When Justin moved back to Chicago after his conquests in the fiery startup scene of New York,
                            he joined Airworthy and got us excited about a more adventurous approach. We were going to
                            give pilots something they had never seen: a cunning, sleek interface and automagic logging
                            so pilots would never need to take their phone out of their pocket. People’s first
                            impression of our app was going to be awe-inspiring.</p>

                        <p>All of a sudden, our scheduled slipped by months.</p>
                        <h4>3. Listen to your gut.</h4>

                        <p>The moment Nick and I started work in 2014, these nagging questions arose in my gut: “How
                            much money are you going to spend on this? How do you know when to quit?” Important
                            questions no doubt! I had the answers when we signed up for Oshkosh. That was it. If we
                            don’t have an impressive product that attracts thousands of pilots by the time we debut at
                            Oshkosh, then I pull the plug. Ah, what a relief to have the kind of certainty! My gut was
                            content.</p>

                        <p>As I mentioned, our schedule had slipped. At Oshkosh, I’m proud to say we had quite an
                            impressive booth. But when it came to demoing the app...even the guy selling shoe insoles at
                            the booth next door could tell it was half-baked. It worked and was “useable,” but automatic
                            logging was far from perfect, and our sleek interface was missing several screens. Buy the
                            end of the week we about 250 pilots had signed up, but none of them were “using” our app. A
                            lukewarm response.</p>

                        <p>Did I listen to my gut and pull the plug? No. “We had only just begun! We debuted too early!
                            Our product wasn’t ready yet! We have to get a real polished version out and then we’ll see
                            the pilots flock in!” That’s what I told myself. More importantly, that’s what Angelique (my
                            wife and, for all intents and purpose, our bank) said. After Oshkosh, we had a blank check
                            and no deadline. My gut recognized this to be a terrible situation, but I didn’t listen.</p>
                        <h4>4. Know your competition before opening the kimono.</h4>

                        <p>This builds on a lesson I learned at 8th Light. Early in 8th Light's existence I was
                            extremely tight-lipped with the competition. They were the enemy, and the less they knew the
                            better. My attitude pulled a 180 when <a href="http://blog.coreyhaines.com">Corey Haines</a>
                            (a true software journeyman) invited 8th Light and 6 of our competitors to a meeting. We
                            called it the Cluster of 7 and in this meeting we poured our hearts out to each other. To my
                            surprise, the world did not end. On the contrary, all of our companies profited from the
                            experience, and these meetings continue today. The point here is that we knew each other, or
                            at least Corey did, and he vouched for each company at the table.</p>

                        <p>On the aviation side of software, I had acquired great respect for a company called <a
                                href="https://www.foreflight.com">ForeFlight</a>. Their iOS app was incredible! We knew
                            they were the most likely candidate to build a competing product, but I wanted to be their
                            friend so bad, just like 8th Light was friends with its competitors. So in March 2015, we
                            got a call with one of their executives and poured our hearts out. We told them all about
                            Airworthy and our road map for features. ForeFlight was kind and respectful, and in
                            retrospect, they may have been taking good notes.
                        </p>

                        <p>At Oshkosh I visited the ForeFlight booth to say hi. I gave them Airworthy t-shirts and tried
                            to have a friendly chat, but it was awkward.</p>

                        <p>In December 2015, ForeFlight announced their new Logbook feature. It basically does what
                            Airworthy did. ForeFlight was nearly ubiquitous amongst pilots and we had no desire to
                            compete. Airworthy stopped development.</p>
                        <h4>5. The only shame is in not trying at all.</h4>

                        <p>Airworthy is my first failed business. Am I ashamed? Nope! And I have no regrets in
                            Airworthy. We gave it our best shot and had a blast doing it. Justin, Nick, and I gained a
                            ton of valuable experience. We’re better designers, developers, and businessmen because of
                            it. And now, the business niche were were trying to fill is filled, albeit by ForeFlight and
                            not Airworthy. But I happily use their logbook feature when I fly now.</p>
